There is new pr on refactoring kompute build system. 
These notes have been taken during the old build system.

Kompute has to be configured with:

cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKOMPUTE_EXTRA_CXX_FLAGS="-DKOMPUTE_LOG_LEVEL=5" -DKOMPUTE_OPT_ENABLE_SPDLOG=0


If you dont have CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release KOMPUTE_EXTRA_CXX_FLAGS are not gonna be aplied (maybe)
If CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug there is some assert in vulkan that fails


To make Kompute work with meson build system one has to:

1) Add vulkan and fmt (dependencies of vulkan) as meson dependencies

	deps += dependency('vulkan')
	deps += dependency('fmt')

(We assume that vulkan and fmt are provided by system)

2) There is some assert that fails in vulkan when we build kompute in debug mode

3) Add libkompute.a as object file to meson executable

	
	object_files = ['/home/pamiro/koodaus/cpp/libs/kompute/build/src/libkompute.a']

	executable('nps', src, dependencies: deps, objects: object_files)


I don't know how much importing vulkan and fmt with meson escpeially importing fmt twiche. With meson and with conan.
